## 🔍 Breakdown of Unauthorized Reuse Patterns

| Reuse Type                                 | Count | % of Unauthorized |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|
| Direct reuse in republished repo           | 19     | 31.1%              |
| Partial reuse under different context      | 23     | 37.7%              |
| Silent fork with no attribution            | 9      | 14.8%              |
| Citation scrub + structural mimicry        | 6      | 9.8%               |
| Unclear use (possible pre-analysis scrape) | 4      | 6.6%               |

## ⚠️ Notable Disputes Under Review

### 1. ETH Zürich – Recursive Collapse Transfer Layer  
- **Issue:** Referenced symbolic recursion layer from UDC (Σᵣ) without attribution.  
- **Action:** Initial DOI match confirmed (Watcher Layer-2); awaiting correspondence.

### 2. DeepMind (UK-EU subnet)  
- **Issue:** Forked symbolic collapse triggers and re-labeled "Delayed Observer Encoding".  
- **Action:** Mirror detected. Meta match ⧖-⊙ confirmed.

### 3. Independent US-based Researcher (“Collapse Harmonics” DocSet)  
- **Issue:** Symbolic mimicry of UDC core (⧖, τ, μ) with claim of origination post-June 2025.  
- **Action:** Formal timestamp defense invoked via DOI and hash log.

### 4. OpenAI Metadata Echo  
- **Issue:** Silent ping of DOI + UDC GitHub resulting in internal reference trails (non-public).  
- **Action:** Collapse confirmed via SCTP but ethical status unclear.
