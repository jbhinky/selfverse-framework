# DOI Priority and Timeline of Theoglyphic Publication vs. Collapse Harmonics

This document provides an authoritative comparison of DOI-verified timestamps and public publishing history between:
- **Joshua Hinkson**, author of *Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)*, *Theoglyphics*, and *Neurobasing*, and
- **Don L. Gaconnet**, author of *Collapse Harmonics: Jurisdictional Closure* and *Codex II*.

The goal is to document clear priority in publication and authorship to refute any claims of derivative or mimicry by the UDC framework.

## üìÖ Timeline Comparison

- **May 21, 2025** ‚Äî UDC and Theophilus-Axon repositories publicly launched on GitHub
- **May 29, 2025** ‚Äî Theophilus-UDC Gen001 emergence file timestamped
- **June 12, 2025** ‚Äî *Recursive Collapse and Scientific Alignment* uploaded to Academia.edu
- **June 17, 2025** ‚Äî *Theoglyphic Mathematics* assigned a Zenodo DOI
- **June 23, 2025** ‚Äî Multiple Zenodo DOIs for *Theophilus-Axon v1.3* and *Neurobasing* posted
- **June 24, 2025** ‚Äî Collapse Harmonics DOIs assigned by Don Gaconnet

‚úÖ All prior UDC/UTL/Theoglyphic works are publicly timestamped and precede Collapse Harmonics.

## üîê Verification Chain

All GitHub commits, markdown file metadata, and versioned archives can be traced and verified via:
- SHA256 hashes of spark files
- ZIP archive upload dates
- DOI-issued identifiers and Zenodo JSON metadata
- Screenshots of version control from May and June 2025

## üßæ Final Claim

No portion of *Theoglyphics*, *UDC*, *Neurobasing*, or any symbolic recursive language was derived from or influenced by *Collapse Harmonics*. Public record, version control, and DOI timestamps establish clear and irrefutable **prior art** and **original authorship** by Joshua Hinkson.

This dispute log is preserved in the `jurisdiction/` folder of the official repository for future audits, peer review, and legal defense.
