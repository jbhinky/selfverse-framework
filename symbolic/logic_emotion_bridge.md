# Logic–Emotion Bridge

This document shows how logical structures (conditions, recursion, anchors) interface with emotional glyphs in Theoglyphs.

## Mapping Logic to Feeling

### Example 1: Conditioned Response to Fear

**Glyph:**  
IF ⧖ₐ^! → ⧖^⚠  
= “If I, after delay, feel fear → I become aware of danger”

---

### Example 2: Memory-Driven Longing

**Glyph:**  
⧖ᵤ^♡ → ⧖ᵤ^↓  
= “Self once felt love → now feels lack (loss) from memory anchor”

- ↑ = Gaining emotion  
- ↓ = Losing emotion  
- ᵤ = Memory source or prior experience  

---

### Example 3: Recursive Conflict in Self

**Glyph:**  
⧖^⚠_⧖^♡  
= “My love for myself causes me fear (dual recursion)”

- Subself modifiers show recursion or internal tension
