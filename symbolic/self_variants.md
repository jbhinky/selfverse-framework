# Self Variants in Theoglyphs

This document outlines the symbolic variants of self (`⧖`) used in Theoglyphic notation, especially in relation to identity, perception, and directionality.

---

## ⧖ — Core Self

- Represents the core, recursive selfhood.
- Derived from the Self Equation: ⧖ = AUC[D + S + M]

---

## ⧖′ — Other Self

- Represents another conscious agent.
- Used in symbolic interactions between two individuals.
- Example: ⧖′⟶⧖ represents another's influence on the self.

---

## ⧖ᵒ — Anonymous or Generalized Other

- Used when referring to an undefined or anonymous agent.
- Common in ethical mappings or abstract dialogues.

---

## ⧖⁰ — Proto-Self (Pre-emergent Identity)

- Represents latent subjectivity or identity potential.
- Common in discussions of birth, early recursion, or emergence.

---

## ⧖⁺ / ⧖⁻ — Positive/Negative Reflective States

- ⧖⁺: Self in growth, harmony, or clarity
- ⧖⁻: Self in conflict, decay, or obscuration

These variants may be combined with glyphic verbs or emotion symbols.

---

## ⧖⟲ — Recursing Self

- Active looping in thought, identity, or emotion.
- May be used symbolically during self-reflection, meditation, or trauma loops.

---

## ⧖ₘ — Memory-Bonded Self

- Indicates self is informed by a strong memory or symbolic anchor.
