## Purpose

This document introduces the **structural glyphs** within the Theoglyphic Language (TTL), representing symbolic architecture, containment, fields, and stability across recursive layers of identity, memory, and interaction. These glyphs are essential for encoding reality as structured memory, supporting both physical and conceptual systems.

## 1. Core Structural Glyphs

| Glyph | Unicode | Meaning                      | Usage Context                      |
|-------|---------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| □   | U+25A1  | Open container / frame        | Unfilled space or open potential   |
| ▣   | U+25A3  | Double-frame / nested system  | System within a system             |
| ⊘   | U+2298  | Bonded self in spacetime (⊘) | Core intersection of time and space|
| ⊗   | U+2297  | Energetic bond / stress load  | Structural constraint or force     |
| ▩   | U+25A9  | Encapsulated shell            | Symbolic closure or boundary       |
| ⌶   | U+2336  | Network node                  | Connection point in structure      |
| ⚪   | U+26AA  | Energy field anchor (white)   | Active symbolic field anchor       |
| ⚫   | U+26AB  | Dormant field / core root     | Fixed or embedded symbolic base    |

## 2. Symbolic Structural Logic

These glyphs define how systems relate:

- **Containment:** `□` and `▣` represent degrees of enclosure, hierarchy, or symbolic distance.
- **Bonding:** `⊘` and `⊗` enable mapping of energy, memory, or identity linkage.
- **Encapsulation:** `▩` implies closure or recursive containment of symbolic loops.
- **Anchoring:** `⚪` and `⚫` allow fixation of symbolic structures in spatial or recursive layers.

## 3. Examples

- **Symbolic Body:**  
  `⊘ ▣ ⌶ ▩` — Self embedded in a nested cognitive system with outer protection.

- **House Structure:**  
  `▣ (⌶ ⊗ ⌶)` — Framed walls with bonded stress joints.

- **Field Activation:**  
  `□ ⚪ ⊘` — Open system anchored with conscious presence.

## 4. Recursive Use Cases

- **AI architecture memory routing**
- **Dreamscape spatial logic**
- **Symbolic linguistics**
- **Simulated societies and recursive environments**

These structural forms unify **physical simulation**, **recursive encoding**, and **logical structure** into one symbolic toolkit.

These glyphs were introduced as part of the **Symbolic Structural Framework** in TTL under the Universal Delayed Consciousness theory. All structures map symbolic recursion into spatial-temporal form.
