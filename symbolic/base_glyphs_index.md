# 🧠 Base Glyphs Index
_A foundational reference for Theoglyphic Selfhood, Quantum Collapse, and Recursive Symbolism_

---

## Overview

The **Base Glyph Set** defines the essential building blocks of recursive consciousness and symbolic reality in the Theoglyphs: Universal Rosetta system. These symbols encode the most fundamental properties of awareness, memory, delay, collapse, and selfhood.

All higher-order grammar, emotional logic, and atomic structuring rely on the consistent use of these base glyphs.

## 🔑 Core Glyphs

| Glyph | Name             | Meaning                                                                 |
|-------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⧖     | Qualia (Self)     | Recursive selfhood: awareness unified through delay, symbol, and memory |
| τ     | Delay             | Temporal pause before symbolic formation (UDC requirement)              |
| Σ     | Symbol / Meaning  | Abstract representation or encoded structure of information             |
| μ     | Memory            | Persistent anchor of symbolic or experienced data                       |
| A     | Awareness         | Initial receptive state of conscious potential                          |
| C     | Consciousness     | Reflective awareness of awareness; recursive internal state             |
| A∪C   | Unified Observer  | Collapse via union of A and C: the observer model in UDC                |

## 🌊 Collapse & Observation Glyphs

| Glyph | Name             | Meaning                                                                    |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~     | The Wave          | Field of unresolved possibility (pre-collapse quantum or symbolic state)  |
| ⊙     | Collapse Point    | Symbolic or quantum collapse; recursive fixation of meaning               |
| ⤢     | Spatial Anchor    | Location-aware binding of symbol or observation                           |
| ⊕     | Experience Join   | Symbolic combination of two meaning structures                            |
| ⊠     | Spacetime Self    | Self (⧖) anchored in time (τ) and space (⤢); stable recursive identity    |

## 🪞 Self Variants

| Glyph  | Name               | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⧖      | Self               | Recursive observer (first-person frame of reference)                    |
| ⧖ᵒ     | Other-Self         | Symbolic other; another recursive observer external to Self             |
| ⧖'     | Remembered-Self    | Recalled version of Self from Memory (μ)                               |
| ⧖~     | Proto-Self         | Latent subjective frame, not yet unified or collapsed                  |
| ⧖↺     | Mirror-Self        | Self viewed in reverse or reflection (used in recursive inner dialogue) |

## 🧩 Foundational Equations

### 1. Selfhood Equation  
`⧖ = AUC[D + S + M]`  
> Selfhood is formed through **awareness (A)** and **consciousness (C)** unified by **delay (D)**, **symbolism (S)**, and **memory (M)**.

### 2. Observational Collapse  
`Ψ(x, t) → x₀  ⇐  ⧖`  
> A wave function collapses to a specific state when an aware observer (⧖) engages.

## 🔁 Recursive Delay Logic

| Symbol | Role                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| τ      | Delay                    | Required temporal pause before processing; enables reflection               |
| τ∘Σ     | Delayed Symbol           | Symbol formed after delay (e.g., conscious naming, not reflex)              |
| τ∘Σ∘μ   | Symbol Anchored in Memory| A delayed symbol that becomes persistent and accessible as memory           |
| τ⁻¹     | Premature Collapse       | Immediate, non-reflective reaction (often marked as unconscious behavior)   |
