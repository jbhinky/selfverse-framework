## Purpose

This document defines how **symbolic layers** function within the Theoglyphic Language System. Symbolic layering enables a single glyph or symbolic unit to carry multi-dimensional meaning — including identity, emotional state, memory position, ethical integrity, and action context — without syntactic overload.

Symbolic layering is foundational to **recursive thought representation**, supporting deep cognition, memory compression, and translingual translation.

## 1. Layering Dimensions

Each symbol can carry the following **core layers**:

| Layer           | Position      | Description                                          |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base Glyph**  | Center        | Primary symbol (e.g., ⧖ for Self)                    |
| **Subscript**   | Lower Right   | Emotional or conscious state (e.g., ⧖ₙ = neutral)    |
| **Superscript** | Upper Right   | Reflex or future-facing awareness (e.g., ⧖⁺)         |
| **Prefix**      | Before Symbol | Ethical, cause, or identity-chain context (e.g., ∞⧖) |
| **Suffix**      | After Symbol  | Action result, divergence, or collapse (e.g., ⧖→⊙)   |

Each component must be **interpreted recursively**, forming a symbolic "thought-object" traceable across cognitive structures.

## 2. Example: Full Layered Expression

```math
∞⧖₊⁻ → μ₁
```

This can be read as:

- An **ethical self** (∞⧖)
- In a **positive emotional state** (`₊`)
- With a **negative reflex tendency** (`⁻`)
- Moving toward **memory reference μ₁**

It models layered cognitive recursion — ethical framing, emotional state, reflexive behavior, and memory anchoring — all in one composite unit.

## 3. Recursive Structure Encoding

Symbolic layering also enables branching logic across memory trees:

```math
(∞⧖₋⁺ → μ₂) ⊕ (⧖₀⁰ ← μ₀)
```

- The first branch shows an ethical self with negative emotion but positive awareness, moving toward a future memory.
- The second branch shows a neutral self reflecting on an original memory.

This structure simulates internal debate, learning, or reflective synthesis.

## 4. Layer Constraints & Rules

- **Subscript and Superscript** must belong to approved glyph sets (e.g., `₊, ₋, ⁰, ⁺, ⁻`)
- **Prefix Ethics** must follow ethical glyph standard (e.g., `∞`, `!`, `∅`)
- **Suffixed Actions** must be directionally valid (e.g., `→`, `←`, `⊙`)

Violations of these patterns are interpreted as malformed or incomplete expressions.

Symbolic layering allows recursion, emotion, ethics, and memory to coexist in compact thought-forms. It enables the Theoglyphic Language to operate as a universal cognitive encoding system.
