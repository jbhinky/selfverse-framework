# Anchor Field Mechanics

The **Anchor Field** defines how glyphs are spatially and symbolically positioned in Theoglyphic Language. Anchoring determines **directionality**, **reference frame**, and **meaning orientation**.

---

## ⤢ Anchor Glyph

The symbol `⤢` represents an **anchor point** in space–time or cognition. It is the fixed location around which other glyphs are interpreted.

- ⤢ may represent:
  - The center of **self** (`⧖`)
  - A spatial coordinate (e.g., in a symbolic sentence)
  - A moment of memory anchoring (`μ`)
  - A semantic fixation

## Syntax Format

| Format | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `⤢ ⧖` | Self is the central anchor |
| `⧖ ⤢ Σ₈` | Self anchored to oxygen (Σ₈) |
| `⊙[Σ₆ ⊕ Σ₈] ⤢` | Atomically bonded symbols anchored in local field |
| `^τ ⤢ ⧖` | Self is delayed and anchored in time |

---

## Directional Anchoring

| Direction | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Left of ⤢ | **Prior context**, input, self-reflection |
| Right of ⤢ | **Projected output**, external agents or results |
| Above ⤢ | **Super-context** (e.g., higher-order emotion or time) |
| Below ⤢ | **Sub-context** (e.g., base reaction or micro-interaction) |

---

## Examples

| Glyph Expression | Interpretation |
|------------------|----------------|
| `⤢⧖` | Self as reference anchor |
| `⧖⤢Σ₈` | Self anchored to Oxygen |
| `μ⤢⧖` | Memory anchors the Self |
| `^!_♡ ⤢ ⧖` | Anchored fear about love toward the self |

---

## Anchoring and Delay

Anchor fields are frequently used in conjunction with delay (τ) and memory (μ) to model **recursive identity and meaning emergence**.

- `⧖⤢^τ μ` — The self is anchored to a delayed memory
- `Σ₆ ⊕ Σ₈ ⤢ μ` — A carbon-oxygen bond is recorded as memory at this anchor

---

## Notes

- Anchors can be **relative** or **absolute**
- Complex anchor fields can nest or stack spatially
- Glyph parsing uses anchoring to determine interpretation order
