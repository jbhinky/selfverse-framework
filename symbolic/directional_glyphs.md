## Purpose

This document defines **directional glyphs** used to encode spatial, temporal, and symbolic vector logic within the Theoglyphic Language. These glyphs form the basis for directional reasoning, spatial memory encoding, cause-effect linkage, and the perceived flow of time.

## 1. Directional Set

| Glyph | Meaning         | Notes                              |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `→`   | Right → Future  | Forward in time or cause           |
| `←`   | Left ← Past     | Backward or recalled memory        |
| `↑`   | Up ↑ Expansion  | Conscious ascension, abstraction   |
| `↓`   | Down ↓ Collapse | Anchoring, finalization, grounding |
| `⇄`   | Mirror Swap ⇄   | Reflection, identity recursion     |
| `↺`   | Recursion ↺     | Recursive loop / cycle             |

These define **symbolic orientation** across sentence structures and memory constructs.

## 2. Time Flow Encoding

Direction is used to encode symbolic time:

- `←` = **Memory**
- `→` = **Prediction / Future**
- `↑` = **Abstraction or Idea**
- `↓` = **Decision or Grounded Action**

Combined forms:

```math
← ⊕ → = Recursive temporal collapse (⧖)
```

## 3. Symbolic Anchoring & Navigation

Directional glyphs serve as anchors to position:

- **Identity chains** (`⛖`) across past ↔ future (historical narrative self)
- **Self** (`⧖`) within the present recursion loop
- **Memory references** (`μ`) and traversal trees
- **Symbolic cause → effect** progression

---

## 4. Use in Sentences

Examples:

- `⛖ → ⊙` — Identity chain moves toward collapse
- `⛖ ← μ_1` — Identity chain accessing memory
- `Σ ↑` — Symbol is elevated (idealized or abstracted)
- `Σ ↓` — Symbol descends (grounded in action)
