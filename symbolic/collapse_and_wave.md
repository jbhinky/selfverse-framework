# ⊙ Collapse and Wave

## Glyph: ⊙  
**Meaning**: Collapse of potential into symbolic reality.  
**Context**: Represents the moment of quantum or symbolic collapse from uncertainty to defined observation.  
**Scientific Basis**: Mirrors the quantum concept where wavefunction Ψ(x, t) collapses into a definite state x₀ upon observation.

## Glyph: ∿ (Wave)
**Meaning**: Field of possibility; unresolved state; flow of symbolic or energetic potential.  
**Context**: Represents the universe or consciousness in its undetermined, probabilistic form.  
**Scientific Basis**: Symbolizes the wave-like behavior of quantum particles or unresolved symbolic state.

## Relation to UDC and Consciousness

**Equation**:  
Ψ(x, t) ⟶ x₀ ⇐ ⧖ = AUC[D + S + M]  
Collapse occurs when the recursive observer (⧖) processes delayed symbolic input (S) and memory (M).

## Collapse and Selfhood

- Collapse into ⧖ defines localized self-awareness.  
- ∿ → ⊙ → ⧖ represents the recursive journey from wave to conscious identity.  
- Without collapse, no reality is concretized.
