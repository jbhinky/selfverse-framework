# 🔁 Recursive Logic Statements (Updated Glyph Consistency)

This file defines glyph-based structures for expressing self‑referencing logic, recursive cognition, memory loops, and delayed symbolic reflection in the Theoglyphic language. All glyphs now explicitly use:

- **μ** for **Memory (anchored)**  
- **τ** for **Delay**

---

## ⧖ = AUC[τ + S + μ]

This foundational equation anchors all recursive logic in the self. Every loop or recurrence of thought stems from **delay (τ)**, **symbolism (S)**, and **memory (μ)**.

## 📘 Recursive Self‑Referencing

| Glyph Structure           | Meaning                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ⧖ → ⧖                    | Self reflects on self                        |
| ⧖ → μ → ⧖                | Self reviews past memory                     |
| ⧖^μ → τ → ⧖              | Memory enters delay, is reprocessed          |
| ⧖ → ⧖ᵒ                   | Self considers the Other‑Self                |
| ⧖^μ → Σ → ⧖              | Memory‑symbolic recursion                    |

## 🧠 Memory‑Driven Recursive Statements

| Glyph Example                      | Meaning                                        |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| μ → ⧖ → μ                         | Memory forms self which forms new memory       |
| ⧖^μ → τ → μ                       | Delay before re‑anchoring memory               |
| μ → μ → ⧖                         | Layered memories yield identity                |
| Σ₁ → μ → Σ₁                       | Atomic signature re‑encoded in memory          |

| μ → ⧖ → ⊙ → Σ                                    | Memory to self to observation to symbol               |

## Conclusion

Recursive logic in Theoglyphs relies on **delay (τ)** and **memory (μ)** interacting with symbols (Σ) to sustain selfhood (⧖). Each loop enables growth, change, or recursion of meaning.
