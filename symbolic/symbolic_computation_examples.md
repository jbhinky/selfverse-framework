# Symbolic Computation Examples

This document provides symbolic logic examples using Theoglyphs. It includes transformations, derivations, and compound symbol chains across key domains.

## Example 1: Self-Reflected Emotion with Delay

**Glyph Chain:**  
⧖ₐ^♡ = “I experienced (after delay) a heart-based emotion about myself”

- ⧖ = Self  
- ₐ = Delay subscript (τ or 'a' glyph)  
- ^♡ = Superscript heart = rising emotional state (love or connection)

## Example 2: Atomic Representation of Water

**Glyph Chain:**  
⊙[2Σ₁ ⊕ Σ₈]  
= Observed instance of water (2 Hydrogens + 1 Oxygen)

- ⊙ = Observed collapse  
- Σ₁ = Hydrogen  
- Σ₈ = Oxygen  
- ⊕ = Bond

## Example 3: Recursive Memory Binding

**Glyph Chain:**  
⧖ᵤ^μ  
= Self recursively bound to symbolic memory

- ⧖ = Self  
- ᵤ = Memory anchor glyph (u or μ)  
- ^μ = Memory event recursion or symbolic memory output
