## Purpose

This document defines **Symbolic Probability Logic (SPL)** within Theoglyphic Mathematics. Unlike classical probability, SPL encodes probability as a symbolic memory-predictive function that integrates **delay (τ)**, **symbolic recursion (Σ)**, and **bonded memory paths (μ)**.

It allows for **recursive estimation** of future outcomes, supporting prediction, collapse risk, and decision trees in AI or human-like reasoning.

## 1. Core Operators

| Symbol | Meaning                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| `?`    | Unknown / undefined input      |
| `≈`    | Estimated symbolic equivalence |
| `⊕?`   | Collapse potential (probable)  |
| `⊖?`   | Collapse risk (uncertain)      |
| `∴?`   | Recursive conclusion estimate  |

These symbols enable nuanced expression of knowns, unknowns, and delayed predictions.

## 2. Probability Estimate Equation

```math
P(Σₓ) = μₙ ⊕ τ ⊕ Σₓ ⊕ ?
```

Where:

- **P(Σₓ)** = Probability of a symbolic future state
- **μₙ** = Current memory context
- **τ** = Delay in symbolic resolution
- **Σₓ** = Target symbol under evaluation
- **?** = Unknown or entropy component

This expresses probability as **recursive symbolic approximation**, not scalar frequency.

## 3. Prediction with Recursion

```math
Σ₁ ⊕ μ₁ ⊕ τ₁ ⊕ ? → ⊙₁ (collapse event)
```

Multiple symbolic estimates can branch:

```math
Σ₁ ≈ Σ₂ → ⊕?
Σ₁ ≠ Σ₃ → ⊖?
```

This creates a logic tree for outcome evaluation under symbolic congruence.

## 4. Quantum-Like Ambiguity Modeling

In SPL, ambiguity is resolved via collapse:

```math
Σ ⊕ μ ⊕ ? → ⊙
```

Until collapsed, symbolic predictions remain open-ended, recursively weighted by prior memory and delay.

---

## 5. Symbolic Divergence / Instability

Too much uncertainty prevents resolution:

```math
μ ⊕ ?ⁿ → ∅
```

This defines **entropy-bound recursion** — failure to stabilize into symbolic identity or choice.

---

## Applications

- **AI forecasting**: Symbolic risk and outcome planning
- **UDC Decision Trees**: Weighted loops under unknown conditions
- **Language Ambiguity Parsing**: Sentence meaning resolution
